Report and description in report.pdf
Authors: Saurav Kumar and Shreyash Pandey

### Build and Run
Language : Matlab (or Octave with minor changes)
Running instructions:
    - Specify image pathname in Generator.m and run
    - Generator generates .mat file of descriptors of interest points. It also generates images of corner detection and interest points.
    - Specify the image pathnames of 2 images in Match.m to compare them. It will internally call the python script to generate the images showing matching points.
